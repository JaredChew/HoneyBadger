2D game engine framework with game genre modules

Dream project of creating a game engine.

The core of this engine is to have lots of flexibility and ease of use.
The main idea for modules is to have an easy plug-in method that makes creating projects of an idea easy and semi-automated.
The biggest plan for modules is to have genre specific modules that helps create games of that genre in an easy manner.
Modules of non game genre will also exist to provide various features that enhance a game.

Example visual novel:
Systems will be in place where dialogue and name boxes are already in position. Simply insert your desired text. Repositioning of said boxes are available too.
Dialogue and scene transisiton would be  in place too, it's will then be a matter of adjusting the way it works to your liking.

Example tile-mapping:
The systems for placement of tile will already be provided, simply state your desired option for each tile.
Options range from tile picture, collision and rendering layer, etc.

Example path finding:
This is a non-game genre module. Provides features of various style of path finding.
Simply add a start and destination, and select your preferered style of algorithm.
Fine tuning of controls will be provided to adjust the searching and moving process.

The engine is probably broken. If I remember correctly I left it at a state where the animation system isn't working anymore.
The last and ambitious idea I had for this project is to implement a 2D-3D genre module. Think Octopath Traveller.
Idea points are written but went nowhere.
